# Random-Number

Math.Random() creates a random floating point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Since it takes 0 as inclusive, I have taken the low variable as 7 and high as 15, so that it generates the random number between 6 and 15 ( both exclusive). 

int ans = r.nextInt(high-low) + low;
